# Coding Quiz

## Description

This app was created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I created this app to test my knowledge of using all three languages together to create a fun game to test the user's knowledge of various development topics - against a sixty second timer.

## Usage

Using the Coding Quiz is very simple and starts with a large "Start Quiz!" button in the center of the viewport. I wanted the entire quiz to be inside of a "card" format with contrasting border to give it a more game-like effect.

Click on the "Start Quiz!" button and the game begins! The timer begins right away - so go quickly!
