# Creating a Coding Quiz with Javascript

Creating this quiz involved proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This first step in creating this quiz was making the overall structure in the HTML file: creating the containers for each section (question-container, timer-container, input-container, controls, high-score-list). These different sections help to separate each major piece of the application for easier styling and manuverability when it comes to using Javascript.

The next step in the process was some minimum styling. I prefere to use simply borders to help me visualize the space that the containers were taking up. I create simple layout and then go back at the end and fine-tune the application at the end.

Once the first-pass on the CSS was done, I created my .js file and started to create the backbone of the project: the interactivity of the application.
Javascript always seems to me like a rippling effect. Once you create one function, you realize you need another, which depends on another variable, which depends on another etc, etc.

My biggest challenge was getting lost in my own code! It was really easy to lose track of the big picture. I used many comments throughout the process to help myself down the road and guide what needed to get done. The comments were very helpful in describing the functionality of each section of code as well.
